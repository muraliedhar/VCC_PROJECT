Oracle RAC on Podman using Oracle RAC Image

Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) has long been the cornerstone of high availability and scalability for Oracle
databases. Traditionally tied to physical or virtualized infrastructure, the rise of container technologies has opened up
new possibilities for deploying RAC in a more agile and resource-efficient manner. This paper explores the feasibility,
architecture, and best practices for deploying Oracle RAC using Podman-a rootless, daemonless container engine.
Drawing from official documentation, practical experiences, and real-world case studies, the paper offers a hands-on
roadmap for DBAs and infrastructure engineers looking to modernize their RAC deployments.
